# Installation
You will need Rust 1.89.0 installed. I recommend using [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/)
```sh
# From the rustup.rs website
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

And then run
```sh
rustup default 1.89.0
```

Then

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `cargo build --release`

You now have a release build! This can be run with `./target/release/poke_search` assuming you're in the root directory of this repository

This project doesn't currently distrbute or release any binaries. For now I'd recommend using an alias if you intend on using this outside of the repo directly
```sh
alias poke_search="/link/to/poke_search/target/release/poke_search"
```

# Usage
See the `help` command for a list of commands that can be run
```sh
‚ùØ poke_search help
